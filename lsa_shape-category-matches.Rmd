Introduction
============

As part of a critical comment on Hayakawa & Keysar (2018 in *Cognition*), we want
to show that it is problematic to assume that the shape task and the category
task in their Experiment 2 require the "same level of knowledge of the language" 
(p. 11). One reason for this is that simple co-occurrence / distributional
patterns of words are predictive of semantic similarity, and thus category
similarity, but not of shape similarity. To illustrate this point I want
to plot the cosine similarity computed using Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA)
for the shape vs category matches.
LSA is not really state-of-the-art anymore, but it might be sufficient to make
our point -- and it has an online tool that can easily be used.


```{r setup, include=FALSE}
library(knitr)
library(ggplot2)
library(ggrepel)  # avoids overlapping labels
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, fig.height = 3.5)
```


Apply LSA
=========

The stimuli
-----------

```{r}
# The stimuli used in Experiment 2
stim <- read.csv("exp2_stimuli.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
```

Each trial in Exp 2 consisted of a triad of words. Each such triad is shown as
a row in the data set:

```{r}
head(stim) %>% kable
```

Remarks:

- There were two lists with different words, each consisting of 24 trials.
For each participant, one list was used for the critical shape and category
tasks (the same 24 items per task, so that task was manipulated within subjects
and items), while the other was used for a control task (the "picture" task,
see HK18, p.11).
- For each triad, the first two words always constitute the shape match and
the last two words the category match (this is also indicated in the two columns
``r names(stim)[5]`` and ``r names(stim)[6]``).
- Note that some of the words are repeated across trials, e.g. "TV screen" is
a category match with "wall clock" on row 5, but it is a shape match with
"toast" on row 6.


Save stimuli to right format for LSA
------------------------------------

We want to create a text file that has the required format for the
[online LSA tool](http://lsa.colorado.edu/cgi-bin/LSA-pairwise.html) we will use.

Word pairs for which we want to compute pairwise cosine distance need to follow
one another separated by a blank line.

```{r}
## create output file
file.create("LSA_input.txt")
# shape matches
for(row in seq_len(nrow(stim))) {
  cat(stim[row, "w1"], file = "LSA_input.txt", append = TRUE)
  cat("\n\n", file = "LSA_input.txt", append = TRUE)
  cat(stim[row, "w2"], file = "LSA_input.txt", append = TRUE)
  cat("\n\n", file = "LSA_input.txt", append = TRUE)
}
# category matches
for(row in seq_len(nrow(stim))) {
  cat(stim[row, "w2"], file = "LSA_input.txt", append = TRUE)
  cat("\n\n", file = "LSA_input.txt", append = TRUE)
  cat(stim[row, "w3"], file = "LSA_input.txt", append = TRUE)
  cat("\n\n", file = "LSA_input.txt", append = TRUE)
}
rm(row)
```


Apply LSA
---------

Go to http://lsa.colorado.edu/cgi-bin/LSA-pairwise.html and paste the input
data from the previous step ("LSA_input.txt") into the corresponding text field.
It should look something like this:

![LSA: input screen](screenshots/LSA-1.png)

After clicking "Submit Texts", the output is the following webbage:

![LSA: output screen (first five pairwise comparisons shown)](screenshots/LSA-2.png)

For each consecutive pair of words there is a cosine distance. This html file
has been saved to the repository as "LSA_output_raw-html.html". The next step
is to extract the cosine values for each comparison.



Cast cosine similarities into convenient data format
---------------------------------------------------

We want to cast the crucial information from the html file into a convenient
format, i.e. into a tabular format.


### Define the format we want to achieve

First, let's create a dataframe with the right format but without the cosine
distances (these we'll add in the next step).

```{r}
# Put shape matches and category matches into one column each
stim$shape <- with(stim, paste(w1, w2, sep = " - "))
stim$category <- with(stim, paste(w2, w3, sep = " - "))
# keep only necessary columns and reshape to long format
cosines <- stim %>%
  select(List, shape, category) %>%
  gather(match_type, word_pair, shape, category)
```

For now the dataframe looks like this (first and last 3 rows):

```{r}
head(cosines, 3)
tail(cosines, 3)
```


### Extract the important info from html file

I will apply a bit of a brute force approach: We'll read the html file as text
and use REGEX to extract the actual results. (R packages such as `XML` might do
this in a more structured way but for our purposes, REGEX will do the job.)

First, read the html file line-by-line and put it into a data frame of one
single column.

```{r}
lsa_out <- read.delim("LSA_output_raw-html.html", header = FALSE, sep = ",",
                      col.names = "text", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
# Note that by using sep = "," we're making sure each line in the file becomes
# one line in our data frame
head(lsa_out)
```

Inspecting the html (in a separate text editor like SublimeText), we can easily
identify which rows contain the crucial information, that is, the words that were
compared or their cosine similarity: These happen to be all the rows that contain
the word "align" in them (because the crucial information appears in a table
format). So let's use this to select only relevant rows.

```{r}
# NB: Using the pipes with dplyr ensures the result is not turned from a 
# dataframe into a vector
lsa_out <- lsa_out %>%
  filter(grepl("align", text))
head(lsa_out)
```

```{r}
# Now we put each pair of consecutive rows together, so that all info for a
# triad is in the same line:
odd_rows <- -1 + 2 * seq_len(nrow(lsa_out) / 2)
lsa_comb <- data.frame(odd  = lsa_out$text[odd_rows],
                       even = lsa_out$text[odd_rows + 1])
lsa_combined <- with(lsa_comb, paste(odd, even))
rm(odd_rows, lsa_comb)
```


This is already some progress: the information for each comparison (i.e., the
two words and their cosine distance) is in one separate row. Only it is buried
in lots of html markup, so let's remove it:


```{r}
# Unwieldy regex, but does the job. We are matching the whole line, while
# capturing the info that interests us in parentheses; this allows us to
# substitute the whole string with just the relevant info using backreferences
# (the "\\1" bits). Note that we need to take into account that:
# 1) The target word sometimes consists of two words ("TV screen");
# 2) Some cosine similarities are NA (marked as "N/A") because the word isn't
#    in the corpus.
lsa_clean <- gsub(".*xts.*ER> ([A-Za-z]+ ?[A-Za-z]*)  .*ER> ([A-Za-z]+ ?[A-Za-z]*)<.*([0-9]\\.[0-9]+|N/A)$",
                  "\\2 - \\1,\\3", lsa_combined, perl = TRUE)
# We replace the 1st and 2nd word in reversed order to match the original order
# (simply a consequence of how html of tables is parsed but of course 
# cosine(A,B) = cosine(B,A) so it doesn't matter).
lsa_clean <- data.frame(collapsed = lsa_clean) %>%
  separate(collapsed, c("word_pair", "cosine"), ",")
lsa_clean$cosine <- as.numeric(lsa_clean$cosine)
head(lsa_clean)
```


### Merge it back to the intended data frame

And finally...

```{r}
cosines <- left_join(cosines, lsa_clean)
head(cosines)
```


Plot the result
===============

```{r, fig.width=4, fig.height=5}
ggplot(cosines, aes(x = match_type, y = cosine)) +
  stat_summary(fun.data = mean_cl_boot, geom = "errorbar", colour = "red",
               width = .2, size = 2) + 
  geom_jitter(height = 0, width = .2, alpha = .3) +
  xlab("Type of match") +
  ylab("Cosine similarity") +
  theme_classic()
```

It might be nice to label some of the more extreme points:

```{r, fig.height=7, fig.width=8, warning=FALSE}
# Labels for extreme values
cosines$Labels <- cosines$word_pair
cosines$Labels[with(cosines,
                    match_type == "category" &
                      ! (cosine <= .05 | cosine > .65) )] <- NA
cosines$Labels[with(cosines,
                    match_type == "shape" &
                      ! (cosine <= .005 | cosine > .35) )] <- NA
# plot with labels
ggplot(cosines, aes(x = match_type, y = cosine, label = Labels)) +
  stat_summary(fun.data = mean_cl_boot, geom = "errorbar", colour = "red",
               width = .2, size = 2) + 
  geom_jitter(height = 0, width = .2, alpha = .3) +
  geom_text_repel() +
  xlab("Type of match") +
  ylab("Cosine similarity") +
  theme_classic()
```
